It took me quite a while to understand and explore DBeaver, here is what I did so far in the lab


SQL for onenf
create table onenf(
orderID serial primary key,
date date,
customerID serial not null,
customerName char(20),
city char(10),
itemId serial not null,
itemName char(10),
quant int,
price money
);

//Added some custom data to it

SQL for twonf
create table twonf(
customerID serial primary key,
itemId serial not null,
itemName char(10),
quant int,
price money
);
